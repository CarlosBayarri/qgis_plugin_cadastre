# AUTOMATIC CREATION OF A MAP WITH CATASTRAL INFORMATION
This project is based on a Qgis plugin that allows us to automatically create a map with cadastral information of a plot in the municipality of Valencia. In addition, it will allow us to select points of interest to display there. The world of GIS programming opens up endless possibilities, as the possible applications are endless. Of the many options that could have been developed, we have chosen the automatic realization of a map with cadastral information using a Qgis plugin. Obtaining maps with legend, scale and all the elements necessary for it to be correct from the cartographic point of view is one of the specialties of our degree, therefore, we consider that making this available to different users is important, and that is why the central objective of our project is the elaboration of a map . On the other hand, the Cadastre is gaining more and more importance, since it is evolving towards a cadastre in which spatial information is essential. In addition, accessing the cadastre information is not always easy, so it has been decided to try to facilitate this work for the user. In addition, considering the possible needs of the users, it has been decided to add information about nearby points of interest, as this information can be very useful for various applications, for example, if a user wants to obtain information about different parcels to help him decide which one to buy. Regarding the technical development of the project, it has been chosen to use Qgis. The main reason is that it is free software, so it is much easier for the user to access it. In addition to this, it has been decided to decontrol a plugin to facilitate the interaction with the user. In this way, the user does not have to have programming notions and can be used on any computer simply by installing this plugin.
